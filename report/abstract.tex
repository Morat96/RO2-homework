In this report we present the traveling salesman problem (TSP), an optimization problem where we want to find the best Hamiltonian path on a given graph, and some deterministic and heuristic solutions to resolve it. The goal of our work is to implement some of the most known algorithms in the literature of the operational research and analyze them to discover which are the best ones to resolve this particular optimization problem.
Each solution is tested on a dataset of different instances, results are then compared using a performance profile. \\
The first part of the report is focused on algorithms based on CPLEX, the solver that we used for this research. These are mostly deterministic algorithms, so they work well only with relatively small instances (less than 600-700 nodes). After realizing the performance profile we can conclude that the best deterministic algorithm is the combination of the UserCut and Heuristic Callbacks based on the Generic Callback.\\
In the second part of the report we analyze generic heuristic solutions (so not based on CPLEX), ideal to resolve very big instances. After our tests we conclude that VNS (variable neighborhood search) is a very good algorithm for the TSP, simulated annealing can also be a valid alternative while the genetic algorithm has very poor performance.
