\chapter{Exact Algorithms}

On this chapter we will describe exact algorithms based on the Dantzig–Fulkerson– Johnson formulation, described in chapter 1. The main problem of this model is that the formulation has $O(2^n)$ SECs, so it is impossibile to implement all the constraints in the model since it would result in a very high execution time and memory usage even for small graphs.
\\ For this reason, SECs constraints are added only when necessary in the model, in order to discard solutions with cycles. Using this technique, hopefully, only a small part of $O(2^n)$ SECs are added to the model.
\\ The main algorithms that make use of this technique are Loop methods and CPLEX callbacks.
